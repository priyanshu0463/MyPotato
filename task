Hey  ðŸ‘‹, considering that everyone is new to web development and has no knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, creating a simple blog website can help in understanding the fundamentals. In this task, you will create a blog page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The blog page should have a header, a footer, and a main section that displays a list of blog posts. Each blog post should include a title, author name, date, and a short excerpt. When a user clicks on a blog post, they should be taken to a separate page that displays the full blog post. To complete this task, you will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You should be familiar with HTML tags, CSS selectors and properties, and JavaScript events and functions.

#1 To begin the task, create a basic HTML page and include the necessary tags and structure. Additionally, you may create more pages and include links to switch between blog pages.

#2 This may appear simple and lacking in aesthetic appeal. However, by adding CSS, you can modify the colors and enhance the visual appearance of the page.

#3 JavaScript can be utilized to add additional functionality to the pages, such as the ability to navigate between pages by clicking buttons.

(Additional) That was straightforward. To enhance the UI/UX of the blog page, you may consider using design tools such as Figma to create mockups and wireframes prior to coding. This can result in a better final product. Experiment with different designs for your blog page.
